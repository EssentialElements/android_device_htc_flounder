         stay in memory.  A low value will keep more processes in memory but may cause
         thrashing if set too low.  Overrides the default value chosen by ActivityManager

         earlier.  A low value allows more memory to be used by processes but may cause more
         allocations to block waiting on disk I/O or lowmemorykiller.  Overrides the default
